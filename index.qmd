## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)
```



```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
library(dplyr)
library(anytime)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(sparkline)
library(DT)
```


*Description of the data and data source*

For this assignment we use the data produces by the National Association of Realtors (NAR). NAR produces housing statistics on the national, regional, and metro-marketlevel where data is available. we use the national historical data (view US data) on https://www.realtor.com/research/data/ (Data from 2016 to 2022)

*what you want to convey in the table*

We are going to make a table that shows the median listing price, the median square feet, the price increased count, price reduced count, and the average price by state.

*what functionality you put into the table and why*
For the functionalty, we make a Tables with *kable* and *DT*. we also add Monthly patterns in Ohio State.

*what formatting you put into the table and why*
kable_styling, kable_paper are the only use in our table.

```{r,warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
house=read.csv("C:/Users/L/OneDrive/Bureau/STAA 566/TABLE/RDC_Inventory_Core_Metrics_State_History.csv",header = TRUE)
house=house%>% rename(Date=month_date_yyyymm)
house$Date=anydate(house$Date)
house$Date=as.Date(house$Date,"%y-%m-%d")
house=house %>% drop_na()
```


## Make a Table with kbl

```{r}
cases <- house%>% 
  filter(Date == max(Date)) %>%
  drop_na()

# Select variable that going to be use for the table.
house_table_1 = cases %>% 
  select(state, median_listing_price,median_square_feet,price_increased_count,price_reduced_count,average_listing_price)
  

# make table
Table_1 = house_table_1 %>%
  select(state, median_listing_price,price_increased_count,price_reduced_count,average_listing_price, median_square_feet) %>%
  kbl(escape = FALSE,
      col.names = c("State",
                    "Median price",
                    "Price increased",
                    "Price reduced",
                    "Average Price",
                    "Median  feet"),
      align = c("l","r","r","r","r","r"),
      digits = 1) %>%
  add_header_above(c(" ","Price Evolution" = 3,  "Square Feet Evolution" = 2)) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size=14, fixed_thead = TRUE)
Table_1 %>% kable_paper(lightable_options = "hover", full_width = FALSE)
Table_1
```


# Monthly patterns for Median listing price and Median square feet

```{r}

N = house %>% group_by(Date)
cases_1 <- N%>% 
  filter(Date == max(Date)) %>%
  drop_na()

cases_trend_1 = N%>%
   filter(Date > max(Date)-31)

## Only in Ohio
co_recent_1 <- cases_trend_1 %>%
  filter(state=="ohio")

## Monthly patterns in Ohio
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
p_listing <- ggplot(co_recent_1, aes(x=Date, y=median_listing_price)) +
  geom_point() + geom_line() +
  theme_tufte() +
  ylab("Monthly count") +
  ggtitle("Ohio Median listing price")

p_feet <- ggplot(co_recent_1, aes(x=Date, y=median_square_feet)) + 
   geom_point() + geom_line() + 
   theme_tufte() +
   ylab("Monthly count") + 
  ggtitle("Ohio Median Square feet")

p_listing  
p_feet
```





```{r}
cases_trend = house %>%
   filter(Date > max(Date)-31)
# one row per state with more recent data
house_table = cases%>% 
  select(state, median_listing_price,median_square_feet,price_increased_count,price_reduced_count,average_listing_price)%>%
  mutate(plt_MP=NA, plt_MF=NA) %>%  # this adds a column to store the plot
  as.data.frame()
```

# Table with DT

```{r}
# make table
DT_table = house_table %>%
  select(state, median_listing_price,price_increased_count,price_reduced_count,average_listing_price, median_square_feet) %>%
  datatable(colnames = c("State","Median price", "Price increased", "Price reduced","Average Price","Median  feet")) %>%
  formatRound(columns = c(2,3,5,6),
              digits = 1)
DT_table 
```
